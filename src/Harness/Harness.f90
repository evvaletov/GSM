!> Harness library
!>
!> The Harness library contains the essential and basic tools used by the
!> majority of the other libraries. The tool is intended to provide robust yet
!> simple interfaces for a variety of simple tasks. Some such task include:
!>    + Constant Declarations
!>    + Basic Contract functionality (e.g., input/output validation, etc.)
!>    + FException (VERY basic emergency exit functionality)
!>    + Testing functionality (for built-in testing - not used in simulations)
!>
!> Note that this interface is meant to simply "pull together" all the harness
!> library components. It should focus on being clear, simple, and effective
!> when used by consumers.
